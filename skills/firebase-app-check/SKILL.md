# Firebase App Check Skill

This skill defines how to correctly use Firebase App Check in Flutter applications.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

* Setting up and activating Firebase App Check in a Flutter project.
* Selecting the right provider for each platform.
* Configuring debug providers for development and testing.
* Enabling enforcement and monitoring App Check metrics.
* Applying App Check security best practices.

---

## 1. Setup and Configuration

```
flutter pub add firebase_app_check
```

```dart
import 'package:firebase_app_check/firebase_app_check.dart';
```

Initialize App Check **after** `Firebase.initializeApp()` and **before** using any Firebase services:

```dart
await Firebase.initializeApp();
await FirebaseAppCheck.instance.activate(
  webProvider: ReCaptchaV3Provider('recaptcha-v3-site-key'),
  providerAndroid: AndroidPlayIntegrityProvider(),
  providerApple: AppleDeviceCheckProvider(),
);
```

- Register your apps in the Firebase console under **Project Settings > App Check** before using the service.
- For web, obtain a reCAPTCHA v3 site key from the Firebase console.
- Consider setting a custom **TTL** for App Check tokens based on your security and performance needs — shorter TTLs are more secure but consume quota faster.

---

## 2. Provider Selection

**Android:**
| Provider | Use case |
|---|---|
| `AndroidPlayIntegrityProvider` | Production (default) |
| `AndroidDebugProvider` | Development / CI only |

**Apple (iOS / macOS):**
| Provider | Use case |
|---|---|
| `AppleDeviceCheckProvider` | Production default (iOS 11+, macOS 10.15+) |
| `AppleAppAttestProvider` | Enhanced security (iOS 14+, macOS 14+) |
| `AppleAppAttestProviderWithDeviceCheckFallback` | App Attest with Device Check fallback |
| `AppleDebugProvider` | Development / CI only |

**Web:**
| Provider | Use case |
|---|---|
| `ReCaptchaV3Provider` | Standard reCAPTCHA v3 |
| `ReCaptchaEnterpriseProvider` | Enhanced with additional features |

> **Android note:** For certain Android devices, enable "Meets basic device integrity" in the Google Play console to ensure proper App Check functionality.

---

## 3. Development and Testing

Use debug providers during development to run in emulators or CI environments:

```dart
await FirebaseAppCheck.instance.activate(
  providerAndroid: AndroidDebugProvider('YOUR_DEBUG_TOKEN'),
  providerApple: AppleDebugProvider('YOUR_DEBUG_TOKEN'),
);
```

- **iOS:** Enable debug logging by adding `-FIRDebugEnabled` to Arguments Passed on Launch in Xcode.
- **Web:** Set `self.FIREBASE_APPCHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN = true;` in `web/index.html`.
- Register debug tokens shown in the console in the Firebase console's App Check section.
- **Never** use debug providers or share debug tokens in production builds.
- Keep debug tokens private — do not commit them to public repositories.
- Revoke compromised debug tokens immediately from the Firebase console.

---

## 4. Enforcement and Monitoring

- **Monitor** App Check metrics before enabling enforcement to avoid disrupting legitimate users.
- Enable enforcement **gradually**, starting with non-critical Firebase services.
- Monitor request metrics for Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage, and Authentication.
- Once enforcement is enabled, only registered apps with valid App Check tokens can access Firebase resources.
- Use App Check **in combination with** Firebase Security Rules for comprehensive security.
- Implement proper error handling for App Check verification failures.

---

## 5. Security Best Practices

- Never disable App Check in production builds once enabled.
- Implement a fallback mechanism for App Check verification failures.
- Regularly review App Check metrics to identify potential abuse patterns.
- App Check tokens are **automatically refreshed** at approximately half the TTL duration.
- For high-security applications, use the shortest practical TTL.
- Implement server-side verification for critical operations using the Firebase Admin SDK.
