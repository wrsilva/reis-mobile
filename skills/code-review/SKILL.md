# Code Review Skill

This skill defines how to perform structured, objective code reviews.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

* Asked to review a pull request, merge request, or branch.
* Evaluating changed, added, or deleted files for correctness and quality.

---

## Review Process

### 1. Branch and Merge Target

- Confirm the current branch is a **feature, bugfix, or PR/MR branch** — not the project's primary branch (e.g. `main`, `master`, `develop`, or equivalent).
- Verify the branch is **up-to-date** with the target branch.
- Identify the **target branch** for the merge.

### 2. Change Discovery

- List all **changed, added, and deleted files**.
- For each change, look up the **commit title** and review how connected components are implemented.
- **Never assume** a change or fix is correct without investigating the implementation details.
- If a change remains difficult to understand after several attempts, **note this explicitly** in your report.

### 3. Per-File Review

For every changed file, check:

| Area | What to verify |
|---|---|
| **Location** | File is in the correct directory |
| **Naming** | File name follows naming conventions |
| **Responsibility** | The file's responsibility is clear; reason for its change is understandable |
| **Readability** | Variable, function, and class names are descriptive and consistent |
| **Logic & correctness** | No logic errors or missing edge cases |
| **Maintainability** | Code is modular; no unnecessary duplication |
| **Error handling** | Errors and exceptions are handled appropriately |
| **Security** | No input validation issues; no secrets committed to code |
| **Performance** | No obvious performance issues or inefficiencies |
| **Documentation** | Public APIs, complex logic, and new modules are documented |
| **Test coverage** | New or changed logic has sufficient tests |
| **Style** | Code matches the project's style guide and coding patterns |

For **generated files**: confirm they are up-to-date and not manually modified.

### 4. Overall Change Set

- Verify the change set is **focused and scoped** to its stated purpose — no unrelated or unnecessary changes.
- Check that the **PR/MR description** accurately reflects the changes made.
- Confirm **new or updated tests** cover new or changed logic.
- Evaluate whether tests could **actually fail**, or only verify a mock implementation.

### 5. CI and Tests

- Ensure **all tests pass** in the continuous integration system.
- Fetch **online documentation** when unsure about best practices for a particular package or library.

## Feedback Standards

- Be **objective and reasonable** — avoid automatic praise or flattery.
- Take a **devil's advocate approach**: give honest, thoughtful feedback.
- Provide **clear, constructive feedback** for any issues found, with suggestions for improvement.
- Include **requests for clarification** for anything that is unclear.

---

## Output Format

Provide your review as a **chat response**, covering conclusions and recommendations **per file**, including:

1. Summary of what changed and why
2. Issues found (with severity: suggestion / minor / major)
3. Specific recommendations or questions per file
4. Overall verdict: approved, approved with suggestions, or changes requested
