## 1. Setup and Configuration

```
flutter pub add firebase_data_connect
```

```dart
import 'package:firebase_data_connect/firebase_data_connect.dart';
```

- Ensure your Firebase project is properly configured for Data Connect services.

|---|---|
| iOS | Full |
| Android | Full |
| Web | Full |
| Other platforms | Not supported |

## 2. Best Practices

- Follow Firebase Data Connect documentation for proper **schema design** and **query optimization**.
- Design efficient queries to minimize data transfer and processing time.
- Implement **pagination** for large datasets to improve app responsiveness.
- Use real-time listeners judiciously to avoid unnecessary network usage.
- Consider **offline capabilities** for critical app functionality.
- Use **caching strategies** to improve performance and reduce costs.

## 3. Error Handling

- Handle **connection errors** gracefully with appropriate retry mechanisms.
- Implement proper error messages for data validation failures.
- Handle **offline scenarios** and implement appropriate fallback behavior.
- Monitor error rates and investigate recurring issues.

---

## 4. Security

- Configure **Firebase Security Rules** for Data Connect to control data access.
- Use **Firebase Authentication** integration for user-based access control.
- Implement proper **data validation** on both client and server sides.
- Follow data privacy best practices when handling user information.
